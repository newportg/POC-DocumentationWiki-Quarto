# Quarto 
Quarto is an open-source scientific and technical publishing system that allows you to create dynamic content using Markdown and integrate executable code (Python, R, Julia, etc.) into your documentation. 

- GitHub Repo as Storage: Yes, this is Quarto's native approach. Your documentation is authored in plain-text Markdown files (or .qmd files) and stored directly in your GitHub repository alongside your code.
- Workflow: It fully embraces the "docs-as-code" philosophy. You use your standard development tools (VS Code, RStudio, command line) to edit files and the entire process (pull requests, code review, versioning) is managed via Git and GitHub.
- Publishing: Quarto can be published to a variety of destinations, including GitHub Pages, using the quarto publish command or automated with GitHub Actions.
- Best for: Highly technical teams who want documentation to be a seamless part of their existing engineering workflow and codebase, and require a high degree of customisation and the ability to embed code execution results.

## Markdown support in Quarto
[Pandoc markdown](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#pandocs-markdown) is an extended and slightly revised version of John Gruber’s [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) syntax.


## Diagram Support in Quarto
Quarto has native support for several diagram formats. 

|Tool | Quarto Support |
|------|----------------|   
| PlantUML & Structurizr| Quarto does not have direct, native PlantUML rendering built-in like Mermaid. You would likely rely on pre-generating the image files (using a GitHub Action or local script with the PlantUML JAR/server) and then embedding them as standard Markdown images. Quarto's general flexibility with Pandoc filters might allow for a more integrated approach, but this requires more configuration.|
| Mermaid & Graphviz | Quarto has native, out-of-the-box support for Mermaid and Graphviz diagrams embedded within special executable cells (e.g., ````{mermaid}`). |


## Code Blocks
Quarto supports fenced code blocks with syntax highlighting for many programming languages. You can specify the language right after the opening backticks.

```python   
def hello_world():
    print("Hello, world!")
```

```r    
hello_world <- function() {
  print("Hello, world!")
}
```
```julia
function hello_world()
    println("Hello, world!")
end
```

```{mermaid}
graph TD;
    A-->B;
    A-->C;
    B-->D;
    C-->D;
``` 
```{dot}
digraph G {
    A -> B;
    B -> C;
    A -> C;
}
``` 

```{.plantuml pumlfile="c4"}
```

```{.plantuml pumlfile="azure"}
```
